# Typescript coding specifics

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Avoid `any` as much as possible
- Prefer type over interface
- Use union types over enums
- Use strict null checks

# Naming

- Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Use PascalCase for types
- Use descriptive names that reveal intent
- Prefix boolean variables with 'is', 'has', 'should'

# exports
- Use named exports over default exports
