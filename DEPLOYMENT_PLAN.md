# Deployment Plan for L'Etabli

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for setting up automated deployments for both development and production environments.

## Prerequisites Information Needed

Before proceeding with the implementation, we need to clarify the following:

- [ ] Frontend hosting platform selection
- [ ] Backend hosting platform selection
- [ ] Domain name strategy (e.g., dev.letabli.fr vs letabli.fr)
- [ ] Required environment variables for both applications
- [ ] Database deployment strategy
- [ ] Static assets storage solution
- [ ] SSL certificate management approach
- [ ] Budget constraints for hosting services
- [ ] Performance requirements (if any specific needs)
- [ ] Backup strategy requirements

## Infrastructure Setup

### Development Environment
- [ ] Set up development hosting environment for frontend
- [ ] Set up development hosting environment for backend
- [ ] Configure development database
- [ ] Set up development environment variables
- [ ] Configure development domain/subdomain

### Production Environment
- [ ] Set up production hosting environment for frontend
- [ ] Set up production hosting environment for backend
- [ ] Configure production database
- [ ] Set up production environment variables
- [ ] Configure production domain

## CI/CD Implementation

### GitHub Repository Setup
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules for `main` and `dev` branches
- [ ] Set up required GitHub secrets for deployments
- [ ] Configure GitHub environments (development and production)

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- [ ] Implement development deployment workflow
  - [ ] Frontend build and deployment steps
  - [ ] Backend build and deployment steps
  - [ ] Environment variables handling
  - [ ] Cache configuration for faster builds

- [ ] Implement production deployment workflow
  - [ ] Frontend build and deployment steps
  - [ ] Backend build and deployment steps
  - [ ] Environment variables handling
  - [ ] Cache configuration for faster builds

## Testing & Validation

### Development Pipeline
- [ ] Test automatic deployment on dev branch push
- [ ] Verify frontend deployment
- [ ] Verify backend deployment
- [ ] Verify environment variables
- [ ] Test rollback procedure

### Production Pipeline
- [ ] Test automatic deployment on main branch push
- [ ] Verify frontend deployment
- [ ] Verify backend deployment
- [ ] Verify environment variables
- [ ] Test rollback procedure

## Documentation

- [ ] Document deployment architecture
- [ ] Document environment variables
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Update README.md with deployment information

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Set up logging
- [ ] Configure alerts
- [ ] Document maintenance procedures

## Questions for Implementation

To proceed with the implementation, please provide answers to the following questions:

1. **Hosting Platforms**:
   - What hosting platform would you prefer for the frontend? (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS)
   - What hosting platform would you prefer for the backend? (e.g., Heroku, AWS, GCP)

2. **Domain Strategy**:
   - Do you have a domain name already?
   - How would you like to structure your development vs production URLs?

3. **Database**:
   - What database are you using?
   - Do you need separate databases for development and production?

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - What environment variables are required for the frontend?
   - What environment variables are required for the backend?

5. **Static Assets**:
   - Do you have any static assets that need special handling (images, files, etc.)?
   - Do you need a CDN?

6. **Security Requirements**:
   - Are there any specific security requirements for the deployment?
   - Do you need any specific SSL certificate handling?

7. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Do you have any specific monitoring requirements?
   - Do you need any specific logging solution?

8. **Budget Constraints**:
   - Are there any budget constraints we should consider when choosing services?
   - Do you have any existing accounts/credits with cloud providers?

Please provide answers to these questions so we can tailor the deployment plan to your specific needs and proceed with the implementation in the most efficient way.
